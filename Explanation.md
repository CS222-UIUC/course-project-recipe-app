Below is a link to my google cloud server - though I belive you may need to input a password. I will explain to the best of my understanding what is going on and
how we will be using this service.

Google cloud acts in a similar way to AWS. We are able to rent out or utilize a gpu from a specific region in the United States in order to allow
our project to run. 

Currently, I am accessing a NVIDIA T4 from Oregon. I am currenlty working on moving the google colab notebook over to jupyter notebook, which should not be 
all that challenging, in order to allow Node.js to easily access the notebook and run in the background.

The only concern is cost, as this server can cost over 1000 dollars a month if left running - so I must always be aware of it.
